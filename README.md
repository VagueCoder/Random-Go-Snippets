# Random-Go-Snippets
A collection of modular code of Golang related snippets, structured into projects. The snippets are originally shared on my [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder). Approach is constructive.

Gists are for sharing the code snippets (similar to [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/)). This is a better explanation of each gist, so rookies to the concept can better understand on how to embed.

Sno. | Name | Gist | Comment
----:|:----:|:-----|:-------
1 | [Fast-Fibonacci](Fast-Fibonacci) | [fastFibonacci.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/03ecd15c42666cb7594790fa263e532f) | Basic fibonacci code snippet with works in goroutines which doesn't give whole series, but n'th number. Also included time module to calculate TAT.
2 | [Files-Filtered-By-Time-Window](Files-Filtered-By-Time-Window) | [filesFilteredByTimeWindow.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/f4ad2a875464e05bc16ac8ef88d79067) | Filters files based on the modified date (start and end time).
3 | [Formatted-Time-Marshalling](Formatted-Time-Marshalling) | [formattedTimeMarshalling.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/5402cadf0707afbbfccc0e0c3abb650a) | Overrides the marshaller function to marshal time.Time object to a specific formatted time string, similar to: "21-May-2021 23:20:08 IST".
4 | [Multilevel-JSON-Unmarshalling](https://github.com/VagueCoder/Multilevel-JSON-Unmarshalling) | [Multilevel-JSON-Unmarshalling.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/37086acb50919a95ef025e0f05c27b61) |  This takes JSON as object and returns slice of all the leaf key-value pairs in the structure. This doesn't preserve details of the depth, but just KVs of all levels.
5 | [Random-Strings](Random-Strings) |  [randomStrings.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/779974d9616e6c108bcaf684c071833a) | This creates a channel which continuously processes and returns random strings of fixed (given) size. And processing can be cancelled at will.
6 | [Go-HashMap](Go-HashMap) | [Go-HashMap.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/3a93f51f5b98ee4537e864fcb49593d7) | Simple demonstration of usage of `map[interface{}]interface{}` as an HashMap in Go. Gist only has insertion. Package implementation has all the possible known functions on HashMap (originally in Java).

## Message to Viewer
A geek to geek: I'd be glad if this comes to use for someone. If you embed snippets from this project in your code, or if you wish to continue developing from here onwards, either ways I totally encourage it. I'm a big fan of open-sourcing. This is all yours to use, buddy!

You can let me know your ideas, or any issues and queries with this project, or if you want to further discuss.
