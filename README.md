# Random-Go-Snippets
A collection of modular code of Golang related snippets, structured into projects. The snippets are originally shared on my [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder). Approach is constructive.

Gists are for sharing the code snippets (similar to [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/)). This is a better explanation of each gist, so rookies to the concept can better understand on how to embed.

Sno. | Name | Gist | Comment
----:|:----:|:-----|:-------
1 | [Fast-Fibonacci](Fast-Fibonacci) | [fastFibonacci.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/03ecd15c42666cb7594790fa263e532f) | Basic fibonacci code snippet with works in goroutines which doesn't give whole series, but n'th number. Also included time module to calculate TAT.
2 | [Files-Filtered-By-Time-Window](Files-Filtered-By-Time-Window) | [filesFilteredByTimeWindow.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/f4ad2a875464e05bc16ac8ef88d79067) | Filters files based on the modified date (start and end time).
3 | [Formatted-Time-Marshalling](Formatted-Time-Marshalling) | [formattedTimeMarshalling.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/5402cadf0707afbbfccc0e0c3abb650a) | Overrides the marshaller function to marshal time.Time object to a specific formatted time string, similar to: "21-May-2021 23:20:08 IST".
4 | [Multilevel-JSON-Unmarshalling](https://github.com/VagueCoder/Multilevel-JSON-Unmarshalling) | [Multilevel-JSON-Unmarshalling.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/37086acb50919a95ef025e0f05c27b61) |  This takes JSON as object and returns slice of all the leaf key-value pairs in the structure. This doesn't preserve details of the depth, but just KVs of all levels.
5 | [Random-Strings](Random-Strings) |  [randomStrings.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/779974d9616e6c108bcaf684c071833a) | This creates a channel which continuously processes and returns random strings of fixed (given) size. And processing can be cancelled at will.
6 | [Go-HashMap](Go-HashMap) | [Go-HashMap.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/3a93f51f5b98ee4537e864fcb49593d7) | Simple demonstration of usage of `map[interface{}]interface{}` as an HashMap in Go. Gist only has insertion. Package implementation has all the possible known functions on HashMap (originally in Java).
7 | [Message-Broadcaster](Message-Broadcaster) | [broadcast.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/e0ede95825b2a8a19553dd090404b028) | This creates a publisher goroutine which continuously returns message (of any type), and related operations.
8 | [Find-GCD](Find-GCD) | [Find-GCD.go](https://gist.github.com/VagueCoder/153d731c60f6358c61cf8bff731a0972) | Code to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 2 or more numbers.

## Message to Viewer
A geek to geek: I'd be glad if this comes to use for someone. If you embed snippets from this project in your code, or if you wish to continue developing from here onwards, either ways I totally encourage it. I'm a big fan of open-sourcing. This is all yours to use, buddy!

You can let me know your ideas, or any issues and queries with this project, or if you want to further discuss. Just write to me at (Click): [VagueCoder0to.n@gmail.com](mailto:VagueCoder0to.n@gmail.com?subject=%5BGITHUB%3A%20Random-Go-Snippets%5D%20Your%20Subject%20Here&body=Hello%20Vague%2C%0A%0A)

## Happy Coding !! :metal:
